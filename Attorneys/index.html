  <h1 class="page-heading">Quantitative Legal Services Market Analysis</h1>
  <article>
  <p>Our consultancy is built chiefly on two factors: our agent-based model of the legal services market (LSM) 

and years of court data. We can provide you with a detailed analysis of the LSM focusing on the areas 

relevant to your practice. In a sentence, we help put our clients in an optimal position to advocate on 

behalf of their clients. </p>

<p>A standard analysis includes a detailed report of:
<ul>
<li>attorney performance across the LSM</li>
<li>defendant outcomes given demographic factors</li>
<li>income-controlled defendant outcomes</li>
<li>the impact of the complainant on trial outcomes</li>
<li>stylized facts gleaned by considering the data within the LSM model</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Our analyses are flexible by design; other variables relevant to our clients can easily be added. </p>
