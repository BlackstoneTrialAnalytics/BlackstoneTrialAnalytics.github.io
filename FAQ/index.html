	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
	<dl class="faq">
		<dt>How Much Does a Consultation Cost?</dt>
		<dd>Each consultation costs $100.</dd>
		<dt>How Long Does a Consultation Take?</dt>
		<dd>In order to perform an analysis, we only need a few pieces of data from our clients. Generally, a completed analysis can be ready for the client within one business day.</dd>
		<dt>Do We Have to Meet in Person for a Consultation?</dt>
		<dd>No, while we have an office near the courthouse in Fairfax, we understand that many of our clients have busy schedules and would prefer to consult over e-mail. Let us know your preference.</dd>
		<dt>What Do I Get from a Consultation?</dt>
		<dd>A standard consultation provides you with five attorney recommendations and analysis of the complainant involved in your case. Each attorney recommendation is based on that attorney’s past success in obtaining outcomes desirable to our clients. Typically, this would include an analysis of past success at obtaining outcomes where charges are dropped, dismissals or not guilty outcomes are obtained, or plea bargains are entered.</dd>
		<dt>Why Does My Complainant Matter?</dt>
		<dd>In the same way that attorneys differ in knowledge, ability and motivation to achieve the best possible outcomes for their clients, complainants (e.g. police officers) also vary in quality. Every complainant has a unique level of confidence at which he or she initiates arrests and every complainant has an associated level of skill in collecting evidence and adhering to procedural rules imposed by the courts. Unfortunately, defendants are typically unaware of their complainant’s historical record. Taking advantage of this fact, prosecutors are often able to persuade defendants to accept an unfavorable plea bargain in lieu of a trial where the defendant actually has a decent probability of securing a more favorable outcome. With a detailed analysis of your complainant’s record, you (and your attorney) are placed in an optimal bargaining position.</dd>
		<dt>How are Lawyers Compared?</dt>
		<dd>Comparing attorneys is relatively straightforward. After controlling for defendant and complainant characteristics, any remaining difference in earned outcomes for a specific case (dropped charges for DUI/DWI cases, for example) is due to differences in attorney quality or ability. Plea bargain quality is evaluated by controlling for relevant defendant and complainant traits in each attorney’s record and weighing their bargained sentences against each other.</dd>
		<dt>Can Law Firms Influence Your Referrals?</dt>
		<dd style="padding-bottom:0;">No, our referrals are based entirely on data derived from court records.</dd>
