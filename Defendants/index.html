            <h3>The Problem:</h3> 
            When accused of a crime, most defendants want to know one thing.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What can I do to give myself the greatest probability of securing a favorable outcome?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Finding an attorney you can trust to give you the best possible defense is a challenge; until now, defendants have had to try to tease out useful information from anecdotes and largely useless top attorney lists. Taking a random sample of top-scoring attorneys from a popular lawyer ratings site, we found that top ratings are actually uncorrelated with win-rates – the metric typical defendants care most about.

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            We have compiled years of court data to provide defendants with win-rate based attorney referrals conditioned on their particular case details.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            One common objection to win-based attorney referrals is that trial outcomes are not easily summarized as either wins or losses. We agree. Our referrals take into account attorney effectiveness in getting charges dropped or winning at trial, but we also account for effectiveness at entering plea bargains and plea bargain quality.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Another important – but often ignored – variable is some estimate of the strength of the case against each defendant. We have found that the complainant is an excellent proxy; complainants tend to arrest at specific confidence levels and their unique, successful prosecution rates are relatively stable over time. We can use this fact to gain additional insight into each of our clients’ cases and prepare reports for our clients’ attorneys to help place them in an optimal position for litigation.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Currently, we offer our attorney referral services to people accused of crimes in:

			To get a sense of the importance of your attorney, check out the chart below. We calculated the win-rate for each attorney with over 50 resolved cases before the various courts in our database of over 8 million records and sorted them into quintiles. The quintile average is reported. Public defender (PD) win-rates have been reported as well on the left side of the graph.
