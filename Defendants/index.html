      Finding an attorney you can trust to give you the best possible defense is a challenge; until now, defendants have had to try to tease out useful information from anecdotes and top attorney lists of unknown pedigree. We have compiled years of court data to provide defendants with win-rate based attorney referrals for their particular case details.

      Currently, we offer our attorney referral services to people accused of crimes in:
      <ul>
          <li>Arlington County</li>
          <li>Alexandria</li>
          <li>Fairfax City</li>
          <li>Fairfax County</li>
          <li>Falls Church</li>
          <li>Loudoun County</li>
          <li>Prince William County</li>
      </ul>
